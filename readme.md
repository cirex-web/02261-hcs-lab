# Features to use

## for classifying untreated and treated

- channel (color) : since different colors highlight different parts of the cell
- average pixel intensity : since treatments such as staining can affect the brightness of a cell
- Hessian: is used in image processing to detect features like edges, corners, and curved structures, offering insight into the local curvature and variation of intensity in the image.
- contrast: helps to determine the quality of the image and the visibility of features within it.

## for classifying lense focus type regardless of stain

- cell size?
- cell density (based on growth) (maybe based on total perimeter length)
  color
  blurriness? <- just this is good lol
